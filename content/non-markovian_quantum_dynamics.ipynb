    "The last decade has seen a renewed interest in theoretical and experimental investigations on fundamental studies of open quantum systems.\n",
    "The reasons for such interest are manifold. On the one hand,  we have witnessed a tremendous advance in the development of quantum technologies, stemming from the ability to coherently control in a robust and efficient manner the dynamics of an ever increasing number of particles. Quantum technologies need to be scalable to reach the market, which entails understanding and minimizing environment-induced decoherence effects in order to achieve the required thresholds for error correction. On the other hand the environment itself has been proven to be experimentally controllable and modifiable. Nowadays reservoir engineering techniques are used for both minimizing the effects of environmental noise and as testbeds of theoretical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "All recent investigations on open quantum systems dynamics highlight the existence of two different classes of dynamical behavior  known as Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. Historically, in the quantum domain Markovian dynamics has been associated to the semigroup property of the dynamical map describing the system evolution. If one thinks in terms of a microscopic model of system, environment and interaction, a Markovian description of the open system requires a number of assumptions, such as system-reservoir weak coupling, and leads to a master equation in the so-called Lindblad form [[1](#1), [2](#2)]. In certain scenarios, however, such approximations are not justified and one needs to go beyond perturbation theory. It is clear that, due to the general complexity of the problem to be studied, exact solutions exist only for simple open quantum systems models such as the well-known Jaynes-Cummings model [[3](#3)], the quantum Brownian motion model [[4](#4)], and certain pure dephasing models [[5](#5)]-[[7](#7)]. \n",
    "\n",
    "During the last decade, a new paradigm in the description of open quantum systems has  emerged. Specifically, a formal and rigorous information-theoretical approach  was introduced and used to define Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics in order to give a clear physical interpretation, as well as an operational definition, to memory effects [[8](#8)-[11](#11), [12](#12)]. Markovian dynamics is characterised by a continuous and monotonic loss of information from the open system to the environment while non-Markovian dynamics occurs when part of the information previously lost into the environment comes back due to memory effects, namely information back-flow occurs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first features that emerges from the analysis of exact models is that memory effects, usually associated to re-coherence and information backflow, do not occur only when the semigroup property of the dynamical map is not satisfied, but are rather associated to another property known as divisibility [[13](#13)]. In this spirit, a non-Markovianity measure quantifying the deviation from divisibility has been proposed in Ref. [[14](#14)]. Other measures (and corresponding definitions) are based on the behavior of quantities such as distinguishability between quantum states, as measured, e.g., by trace distance [[12](#12), [15](#15)] or fidelity [[16](#16)], quantum mutual information between initial and final state [[17](#17)], channel capacities [[18](#18)], Fisher information [[19](#19)], and the volume of accessible physical states of a system [[20](#20)].\n",
    "\n",
    "What one defines as Markovian or non-Markovian dynamics is, in a sense, a question of semantics. It is tautologic to say that, in general, different definitions and corresponding measures of non-Markovianity do not coincide. In this chapter we prefer to follow a more pragmatic approach. We will not insist on the concept of  \"the best\" definition of non-Markovianity  but we rather look at different measures as descriptions of different properties of the open quantum systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our study will encompass the Rivas, Huelga, Pleanio (RHP) divisibility measure of  [[14](#14)], the Breuer, Laine, Piilo (BLP) distinguishability measure  [[12](#12)], the Luo, Fu, Song (LFS) coherent information measure [[17](#17)], and the Bylicka, Chruściński, Maniscalco (BCM)  channel capacity measures [[18](#18)]. We will consider as example single qubits immersed in purely dephasing environments as well as dissipative environments."

    "The concept of Markovian and non-Markovian stochastic process has a clear and rigorous formulation in the classical domain. The extension to quantum processes, however, is not straightforward. Open quantum systems, indeed, may display dynamical features which do not have a classical counterpart, such as re-coherence, information trapping, entanglement sudden death and revivals, and so on. For this reason, the generalization of the definition of Markovian/non-Markovian process from classical to quantum is still the subject of an intense debate (for reviews see Ref. [[8](#8)-[11](#11)]). Generally speaking, there are two approaches to the definition of quantum non-Markovianity. The first one focuses on the properties of the master equation or the corresponding dynamical map, while the second one emphasizes the need of a more physical approach,  identifying memory effects with the occurrence of information back-flow. The latter approach does not require the knowledge of the explicit form of either  the master equation or dynamical map, and has been pioneered by Breuer, Laine and Piilo, who introduced the now famous BLP non-Markovianity measure [[12](#12)]. In the following we review both perspectives and recall their connection."

    "Hystorically, Markovian open quantum dynamics was identified with the GKSL form of the master equation and was extensively used due to its powerful property of guaranteeing complete positivity (CP), and hence physicality, of the density matrix at all times. A straightforward extension of the GKSL theorem [[1](#1), [2](#2)] to time local master equations identifies Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics with the properties of the dynamical map $\\Phi_t: \\rho(t)=\\Phi_t \\rho(0)$ characterizing the open system evolution. More precisely, the dynamics is said to be Markovian whenever the dynamical map possesses the property of being completely-positive (CP) divisible, namely whenever the propagator $V_{t,s}$, defined by $\\Phi_t = V_{t,s} \\Phi_s$, is CP.  On the contrary, non-Markovian dynamics occurs when the dynamical map $\\Phi_t$ is not CP divisible.\n",

However, while non-monotonic behavior of such quantities always implies non-divisibility, the inverse is not true, i.e., there can be non-divisible maps consistent with monotonic dynamics. In this sense, if one would assume divisibility as the definition of non-Markovianity, all the other non-Markovianity measures should be considered as non-Markovianity witnesses.\n",

On the contrary, the other measures all depend on the dephasing factors $e^{-\\Gamma(t)}$ calculated at times at which the direction of information flow changes, i.e. $t=a_i$ and $t=b_i$.

Indeed a strong dependence on the form of the environmental spectrum can be noticed. More precisely, in the case of the Lorentzian spectrum we have $\\N_\\text{C}(\\Phi^A)>\\N_\\text{I}(\\Phi^A)$, while in the PBG model the opposite relation holds (see [Figure 2](#fig_2) i) and  ii), respectively). \n",

The above example is consistent with the intuitive idea that the transmission of quantum information along a quantum channel is more sensitive to noise than the transmission of classical information (although assisted by entanglement shared between Alice and Bob). Once again this conclusion is, however, spectrum-dependent. In the case of the PBG model ([Figure 2](#fig_2) ii)) it is possible to set the parameters such that the noise in the channel has almost the same effect on both kinds of information. This is possible for  $z<0$, because $|G(t)|^2$ in this regime oscillates only above the value $\\frac{1}{2}$, but it is no longer true for $0\\leq z < 2$ as shown in [Figure 2](#fig_2) ii) -- the biggest difference occurring for $z=0$."

Non-monotonic behaviour of the witness as a function of time signals non-Markovianity. Other witnesses of non-Markovianity (such as the BLP measure [[12](#12)]) could be implemented, and may be more efficient at detecting memory effects, but they generally require a larger number of measurements or optimization over initial states."

Namely, this quantity is defined as $f_{\\Phi} = \\langle \\phi^{+} | \\mathbb{I} \\otimes \\Phi_t [| \\phi^{+} \\rangle \\langle \\phi^{+} | ] | \\phi^{+} \\rangle$.
