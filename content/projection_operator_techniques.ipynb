    "The projection operators techniques that we will describe in this section aim at deriving the dynamics of an open quantum system starting from the total unitary evolution. We are going to show two possible techniques that go beyond the Born-Markov approximation, allowing us to describe open systems even when system-environment correlations are not negligible. These two techniques are 1) the Nakajima-Zwanzing technique; 2) the time-convolutionless (TCL) technique.

    "The equation above is called the Nakajima-Zwanzig master equation.  It is worth noticing that this is an exact equation for $\\mathcal{P}\\varrho$. We call the integrand in the second term the memory kernel $K(t,s)=\\mathcal{PL}(t)G(t,s)\\mathcal{QL}(s)\\mathcal{P}$. This term describes the memory effects due to non-negligible correlations between system and environment. Note that the Nakajima-Zwanzig equation, contrary to all master equations studied so far, is an integro-differential equation, namely the future dynamics of the open system depends on its past history and not only on its initial state. The first term in Eq. ([6.5](#mjx-eqn-NZtech5)) is known as the inhomogeneity term. This term takes into account the effect of initial correlations between system and environment.  Assuming factorized initial conditions we get $\\mathcal{P}\\varrho(t_{0})=\\varrho(t_{0})$ and $\\mathcal{Q}\\varrho(t_{0})=0$, hence the inhomogeneity term vanishes in the absence of correlations between system and environment at the initial time. Note that, if $K(t,s) \\propto \\delta(t-s)$, then the Nakajima-Zwanzig equation becomes time-local, i.e., there are no memory effects."
