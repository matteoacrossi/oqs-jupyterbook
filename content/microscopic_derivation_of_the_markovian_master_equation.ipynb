    "An open quantum system is a system $S$ which is coupled to an environment $B$. It is therefore a subsystem of the total system $S+B$. The total system is usually considered a closed system, i.e., its evolution follows Hamiltonian dynamics. The state of the system $S$ will change due to both its internal dynamics and the interaction with the environment $B$. Due to the establishment of system-environment correlations the dynamics of $S$ cannot be considered unitary anymore. The dynamics of $S$ induced by the total system dynamics is called reduced system dynamics and $S$ is also known as reduced system. The density matrix of the reduced system $\\varrho_{S}$ is obtained from the density matrix of the total system $\\varrho_{SB}$ by performing a partial trace over the environmental degrees of freedom $\\varrho_{S}\\equiv \\textrm{Tr}_{B}[\\varrho_{SB}]$.\n",

These are not the minimal assumptions, however. Namely, there exist physically meaningful master equations that are more general than the type we are going to derive in the following. We will examine the more general cases later during the course. For now, let us focus on what are known as Markovian master equations and let us describe the assumptions that are needed to derive them following a microscopic approach. It is important to stress that Markovian master equations have played a prominent role in the advancement of fields of importance such as quantum optics and quantum information theory as they are very good approximations in a number of physical scenarios  (e.g., for trapped ions and cavity QED systems)."
